#ifndef LAYOUT_H
#define LAYOUT_H

// Convenient Macros for placing objects in columns and rows.
// Next project, just use QLayout.
//
// Use the LAYOUT macro to declare the (x,y) starting point in pixels,
// as well as the horizontal and vertical spans in pixes to the next
// QObject.
//
// Then use the POINT macro to place each object with simple (column,row)
// notation.

// LAYOUT - takes the x and y coordinates in pixels relative to the upper left
//          corner of the window on which the widget will be placed.
//
// x    - pixel x-coordinate of upper left corner of widget relative to
//        upper left corner of the window upon which it is placed.
// y    - pixel y-coordinate of upper left corner of widget.
// hs   - horizontal span, distance in pixels to the next widget to the right
//        in the layout. Zero here indicates the layout is vertical.
// vs   - vertical span, distance in pixels to the next widget below in the
//        layout. Zero here indicates the layout is horizontal.
//

// CELL
// This macro allows us to use "column,row" placement of widgets, once the
// LAYOUT macro is called to express the layout in pixels. The CELL macro
// takes the const int definitions made by LAYOUT and converts them to
// pixel coordinates in a QPoint. All the user has to do is indicate which
// column,row for the widget, wich makes layout a lot easier.
